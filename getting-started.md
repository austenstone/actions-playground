## From scratch

First I have to [Sign Up](https://github.com/signup?source=login) for a GitHub account.

Then I have to [Create a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo) to run Actions.

## Create a workflow
Try out the features of GitHub Actions in 5 minutes or less in the [Quickstart for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart).

## User Interface
GitHub has a nice UI for [monitoring and troubleshooting](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows). You can view the status and results of each step in your workflow, debug a failed workflow, search and download logs, and view billable job execution minutes.

## Secrets
Encrypted [Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) allow you to store sensitive information in your organization, repository, or repository environments. There are secrets at both the [organization](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#reviewing-access-to-organization-level-secrets) and [repository](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository). You can even create [enviornment secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-an-environment).

## Reuse third-party snippets
You can use [Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/finding-and-customizing-actions) from the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?category=&type=actions). Use the millions of open source libraries available on GitHub to create your own actions. Write them in JavaScript or create a container actionâ€”both can interact with the full GitHub API and any other public API.
