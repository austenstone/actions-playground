GitHub Actions makes automation easy!

Improve the quality of your code and make your life more productive through devops!

# [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)

Automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows right in your repository with GitHub Actions. You can discover, create, and share actions to perform any job you'd like, including CI/CD, and combine actions in a completely customized workflow.

### [Events that trigger workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows)

You can configure your workflows to run when specific activity on GitHub happens, at a scheduled time, or when an event outside of GitHub occurs.

# [Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/finding-and-customizing-actions)

Actions are the building blocks that power your workflow. A workflow can contain actions created by the community, or you can create your own actions directly within your application's repository. This guide will show you how to discover, use, and customize actions.

The GitHub Marketplace is a place where you can share your apps and actions publicly with all GitHub users.

Anyone can publish an action in GitHub Marketplace. GitHub verifies some partner organizations and these are shown as verified creators.

## [Status Checks](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/collaborating-on-repositories-with-code-quality-features/about-status-checks)

Status checks let you know if your commits meet the conditions set for the repository you're contributing to.

If status checks are required for a repository, the required status checks must pass before you can merge your branch into the protected branch. For more information, see "[About protected branches](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches#require-status-checks-before-merging)."

## [Environments](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment)
Environments are used to describe a general deployment target like `production`, `staging`, or `development`.

You can configure environments with protection rules and secrets. A workflow job that references an environment must follow any protection rules for the environment before running or accessing the environment's secrets.
