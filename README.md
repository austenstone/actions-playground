# Status Checks

Status checks let you know if your commits meet the conditions set for the repository you're contributing to.

If status checks are required for a repository, the required status checks must pass before you can merge your branch into the protected branch. For more information, see "[About protected branches](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches#require-status-checks-before-merging)."
